### Overture
##### Written by William Waddell, as part of the final project for CS 4783-5783 at OKState.

------------

#### Dependencies
- **NumPy**
	*Used for fast matrix operations.*
- **Keras**
	*Used to fetch the MNIST10 dataset; this is technically not a dependency.*
- **Python 3.10**
	*Can likely be run on newer versions as well.*

------------

#### Description
This project aims to be a flexible from-scratch machine learning framework, similar to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/ "Tensorflow") / [Keras](https://keras.io/ "Keras") / [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/ "PyTorch"). 

Sample code highlighting this project can be found in main.py, which can be run as-is on Python 3.10.
